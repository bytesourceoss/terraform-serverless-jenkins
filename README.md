# terraform-serverless-jenkins

Terraform module to showcase running Jenkins serverlessly on AWS Fargate.

Disclaimer: This module is not intended for production use. Data and connections are not encrypted, and the IAM role used for the Jenkins master provides full Administrative access. If you want to run a setup like this in production reach out to us at ++link to quiz here++

## Usage

```
module "serverless_jenkins" {
  source = <todo, upload to terraform registry>

  public_subnets = ["subnet-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "subnet-bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"]
  private_subnets = ["subnet-ccccccccccccccccc", "subnet-ddddddddddddddddd"]
  vpc_id = "vpc-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "Serverless Jenkins"
  }
}

output instructions {
  value = <<EOT
Access the Jenkins master via http://${module.serverless_jenkins.loadbalancer_url}.
The first startup will take a few minutes. To configure the ECS and EC2 Plugins you need the following:

RSA Private Key: ${module.serverless_jenkins.rsa_private_key}
RSA Public Key: ${module.serverless_jenkins.rsa_public_key}

SecurityGroup for EC2 agents: ${module.serverless_jenkins.security_group_ec2}
SecurityGroup for ECS agents: ${module.serverless_jenkins.security_group_ecs}
Alternative Jenkins URL for ECS Plugin: http://${mdoule.serverless_jenkins.ecs_loadbalancer_url}:8001
Subnets for EC2 and ECS: ${join(", ", module.serverless_jenkins.private_subnets)}

To mount the EFS once create and read the initial admin key createn an EC2 instance with these:
  Security Group: ${module.serverless_jenkins.security_group_jenkins_master}
  IAM Instance profile: ServerlessJenkinsECSTaskContainerRole
Mount the FS with: mount -t efs -o tls,iam,accesspoint=${module.serverless_jenkins.efs_access_point_id} ${module.serverless_jenkins.efs_file_system_id}: /tmp/efs
EOT
}
```

Due to the nature of Terraform and our high security standards this module has to be planned and appied in two steps.

```bash
# First the network loadbalancer
terraform plan -out=tf.plan -target module.serverless_jenkins.aws_lb.nlb
terraform apply tf.plan

# Then the rest
terraform plan -out=tf.plan
terraform apply tf.plan
```

Once everything is running you can try to access the ApplicationLoadBalancer URL and it should show you a screen asking for an initial administrative password. To get this password create a temporary EC2 instance with the security group and IAM instance profile from the output of terraform and mount the EFS share. You will probalby first need to install the efs helper package via yum. Once you have the initial password you can destroy the instance.
